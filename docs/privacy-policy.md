At Korea Chain, we respect your privacy and your freedom. We do not collect, store, process, or track any personal data. We do not identify our users, nor do we have any interest in doing so.

The blockchain itself is an **open, decentralized network**. Any data included in transactions is publicly visible and beyond our control. For this reason, we encourage users to encrypt any sensitive data they choose to store on-chain.

By using Korea Chain, you acknowledge that on-chain data is immutable and not managed by us or any central authority.

We are committed to openness, transparency, and protecting your right to privacy in a decentralized world.
