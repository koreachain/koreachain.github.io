# Ultra-scalable AI Blockchains

:::info[Live now]
This revolutionary architecture is 100% complete and ready to power the future of sovereign blockchains!
:::

***“Infinitely Hyper-scalable Parallel-layered Multi-blockchain Mesh”*** is the AI-native architecture powering all our current and future sovereign blockchains. A future-ready network of parallel RollApps, each AI-optimized and governed by intelligent agents. This bootstraps a new era of **personalized intelligent blockchain systems**, purpose-built for **performance, security, and interoperability**.

Built on the **Web3 *“dream stack”*** — Dymension’s modular settlement layer + Celestia’s ultra-scalable data availability layer, and leveraging the full power of ***Go Ethereum v1.12.0, Dymension RDK v1.10.0, the Cosmos SDK v0.46.16, CometBFT v0.34.29 Tendermint, Evmos v12, Ethermint v0.22.0, and Celestia v0.23.5***, our blockchains are:

- **Flexible to choose its L1 DA layer** network from the most battle-tested, ultra-scalable, and high-performance available.
- **100% Ethereum-compatible**.
- Natively connected to the **Cosmos ecosystem** via the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).
- Provided with a fast-lane between **Ultra-scalable AI Blockchains** through secure messaging using the Inter-RollApp Communication Protocol (IRC).

Our best foundation delivers:

- **Enshrined security** — Rollup logic embedded directly at the protocol level with strong L1-grade protection.
- **Blazing scalability** — Celestia’s DA layer provides unmatched throughput for high-volume use cases.
- **Seamless interoperability** — Native IBC and cross-rollup communication connect you to the entire Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems.

Where competitor rollup solutions and monolithic chains rely on smart contracts and multisigs (and the associated attack vectors), our blockchains inherit **direct security from the settlement layer, eliminating single points of failure:**

- **Native security model** — Direct security enshrined at the protocol level — rollup execution is integrated into the base layer for maximal security.
- **Trustless finality** — No intermediaries, no multisigs — just verifiable, protocol-native consensus.
- **Network-guaranteed settlement** — Transactions finalize with full Layer 1 security, inheriting the guarantees of the underlying modular settlement layer.

By being **enshrined at the L1 level**, our blockchains benefit from **shared security, native liquidity, seamless interoperability, and incredible speed**. This means our architecture **is not just scalable — it is future-proof**.

Being AI-optimized and governed by intelligent agents that continuously learn from common patterns to enhance performance and security, they oversee validators and their infrastructure, manage resource allocation, and influence major decisions affecting the entire ecosystem — thus creating a truly evolving domain for **blockchains that are managed intelligently**.

Infinitely Hyper-scalable Parallel-layered Multi-blockchain Mesh is more than interconnected L2 rollups — it is the next evolution of the internet itself — the “***Internet of Blockchains Revolution***”.
